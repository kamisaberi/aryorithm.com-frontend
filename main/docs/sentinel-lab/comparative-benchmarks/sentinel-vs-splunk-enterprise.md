# Resource Utilization: Sentinel-Lab vs. Splunk Enterprise

Splunk Enterprise requires extensive server clusters (Search Heads, Indexers, Heavy Forwarders) to ingest and index high-frequency network flow streams.

## 1. Resource Consumption Comparison

| System Resource | Splunk Enterprise Clustered Indexer | `sentinel-lab` Appliance Daemon |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RAM Footprint (Idle)** | $16.0\text{ GB}$ (JVM & Search Processes) | **$180\text{ MB}$ (Static C++ Pinned Memory)** |
| **RAM Footprint (Saturation)**| **$68.0\text{ GB}$** | **$< 2.0\text{ GB}$ (Bounded Ring Buffers)** |
| **Disk Storage (Per Day)** | $\sim 1.2\text{ TB}$ (Raw Splunk Index Buckets) | **$0\text{ MB}$ (In-Memory Evaluation / Zero Egress)**|
| **Execution Runtimes** | Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Python | **Native ISO C++20 & Linux eBPF** |
| **Cloud Egress Fees** | Thousands of Dollars / Month | **$0.00 (100% On-Premises Edge)** |

## 2. Edge Deployability

Splunk Enterprise cannot be deployed on a DIN-rail industrial gateway or edge field computer due to extreme hardware prerequisites. `sentinel-lab` executes comfortably on fanless edge silicon consuming under $15\text{ Watts}$.
